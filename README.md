# About This Page
- I've collected information about Star Wars: Age of Rebellion, a table top roleplaying game, and created a reference for it for nearseamless information gathering. 
- I intend to use this web app for personal use only.
- I am not affiliated with the linked content in any way
- This page dynamically uses markdown files and translates them into JSON to populate cards in the Rules Reference section. 

# Adding Cards to the References Documentation
- Create a markdown file in the Markdown subdirectory.
- The name of the file will be displayed as the card's title.
- The headings of the markdown file will be accordions held within the card, with the heading name as it's own title
- Bulleted points within the heading will be shown within that respective accordion
- Add the title, icon, and file path to manifest.json, which is in the in the root directory.
- Title should match the name of the markdown file, icon will be the classes used for the desired icon from Font Awesome, and file is the relative file path to the markdown file.
