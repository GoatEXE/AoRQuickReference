# Duty Mechanics
- A position held within the Rebellion. It comes with a title and a numeric value, which represents acomplishments or good will. (p.46)
- Characters start somewhere between 5 and 20 duty score, totaling between 30 and 50 partywide. This can be spent to increase starting credits and experience, but at the cost of a reduced standing with the Rebellion. Each option on table 2-2 can be bought only once.
- Can effect reputation. (p.325)

# Duty Roll
- Organize the party's duty score from highest total ascending to lowest (observe table on p.48).
- GM rolls percentile dice at the start of the session, and compare it to the party's combined duty score.
- If percentile > duty score: Nothing happens. The Rebellion is not yet impressed with the party.
- If percentile <= duty score: characters get +1 to wound threshold. Additionally, the triggering character is provided +2 instead. If the percentile roll are doubles (11, 22, etc), then also double this effect for all players.

# Duty Rewards
- Once the party's Duty Value reaches 100, their contribution rank is increased by 1, and is rewarded by the Alliance. Duty is then reset to 0. 
- Rewards can be: equipment, vehicle, strategic asset. Equipment, vehicle, or starship cannot be greater than rank 3 + contribution rank.
