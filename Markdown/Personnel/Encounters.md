# Process
- Determine Initiative by making a Simple (no difficulty) Cool or Vigilance check. (Cool if starting a planned encounter) (p.210)
- Highest success to lowest. Ties are broke by advantage. If PC and NPC are still tied, PC goes first.
- Turns consist of any amount of incidentals, at least 1 maneuver but not more than 2, and at least one action which is typically a skill check.

# Incidentals
- Speaking to a character
- Dropping an item
- Minor movements like looking around a corner

# Maneuver
- You can perform an extra maneuver at the cost of 2 strain, unless otherwise noted.
- Maneuver can be awarded outside of a character's turn in special circumstances. This does not count against the character's maneuver count.
- Aiming - provides a bonus to the next attack if not interrupted by damage, takes no action, and doesn't move. +1 boost, +2 if used twice in a row. You can target a specific part on a person or something they hold. +2 setback if used once, +1 if used twice in a row.
- Assisting a character adds +1 boost to their next skill check, which is lost if not used that next turn.
- Guarded Stance adds +1 defense to melee, but adds +1 setback to the next attack. Both until the end of their next turn.
- Moving one range increment (p.221) including disengaging
- Going to and from prone require a maneuver. +1 ranged and -1 melee defense while prone.
- Interact with the enviornment, like diving behind cover (+1 ranged defense).
- Manage gear (draw, holster, ready, load)
- Mount, dismount
- Preparation

# Action
- Exchange an action for a maneuver. Cannot perform more than 2 maneuvers.
- Spend action to activate a character ability
- Activate a force power
- Perform skill check
- Perform combat check
