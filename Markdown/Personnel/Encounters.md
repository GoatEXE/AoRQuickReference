# Process
- Determine Initiative by making a Simple (no difficulty) Cool or Vigilance check. (Cool if starting a planned encounter) (p.210)
- Highest success to lowest. Ties are broke by advantage. If PC and NPC are still tied, PC goes first.
- Each turn consists of any reasonable amount of incidentals, 1 manuver (cannot use more than 2 in a round), and 1 action (typically a skill check like attacking).

# Incidentals
- Things that take very little to no effort. (p.212)
- Speaking to a character.
- Dropping an item.
- Minor movements like looking around a corner.

# Maneuver
- Physical movements like positioning or interacting with the environment.
- You can perform an extra maneuver at the cost of 2 strain, unless otherwise noted. (p.213)
- Maneuver can be awarded outside of a character's turn in special circumstances. This does not count against the character's maneuver count.

# Generic Maneuvers
- <b>Aiming</b>: provides a bonus to the next attack if not interrupted by damage, takes no action, and doesn't move. +1 boost, +2 if used twice in a row. You can target a specific part on a person or something they hold. +2 setback if used once, +1 if used twice in a row.
- <b>Assist</b>: +1 boost to assisted character's next skill check, which is lost if not used that next turn.
- <b>Guarded Stance</b>: add +1 defense to melee, but adds +1 setback to the next attack. Both effects last until the end of the next turn.
- <b>Moving</b>: Adjust position one range increment (p.221) including disengaging.
- <b>Prone</b>: Moving to and from prone require a maneuver. +1 ranged and -1 melee defense while prone.
- <b>Interact</b>: Engage with a control panel or anything in the enviornment, like diving behind cover (+1 ranged defense).
- <b>Manage gear</b>: draw, holster, ready, load
- <b>Mount and dismount</b>: 1 manuever for boarding a vehicle or mounting domesticated beasts of burdeon. Untrained must pass a DC2 survival check.
- <b>Preparation</b>: Time spent to prepare. Some actions require this maneuver to be used prior to its activation as a game-balancing mechanic.
