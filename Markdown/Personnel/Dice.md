- Find the skill and parent trait value. The number of ability dice (d8) rolled are equal to the higher of the two values. (p.26)

- Address wounds from crits/environment as necessary for setback dice (d6) (p.27-28)
- GM can difficulty to chalenge dice (d12) as necessary (destiny points)
- Downgrade where applicable. Dice cannot be removed from play via downgrade. (p.29)

# Destiny Pool

- Using a light side destiny point increases the dark side pool, and vice versa.
- To generate a destiny pool, each player character must roll the white D12, not GM.
- Size of the pool does not change for this session.
- One destiny point spent per action.
