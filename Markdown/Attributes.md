# Attributes
- Wound Threshold: physical damage taken before knocked out. Treated with medicine. Droids would use Mechanics. Initially determined by Brawn. Increases to Brawn after creation does not effect wound threshold. (p.37)
- Strain Threshold: how much stress someone can handle before passing out, dazed, or stunned. Can be used as a resource for certain abilities. Initially determined by Willpower. Increases to Willpower after creation does not effect the strain threshold.
- Defense: How difficult it is to be hit in combat. Melee/Ranged have separate values. Cover and equipment provide defense.
- Soak Value: Damage to the player is reduced by this amount. Soak is equal to Brawn, and changes to Brawn does effect soak.
