# Duty Mechanics
- A position held within the Rebellion. It comes with a title and a numeric value, which represents acomplishments or good will.
- Characters start somewhere between 5 and 20 duty score, totaling between 30 and 50 partywide. This can be spent to increase starting credits and experience, but at the cost of a reduced standing with the Rebellion. One option can be bought once.
- GM to roll percentile die at the start of the session. A roll greater than the party's combined duty score means that the Rebellion is not yet impressed with them. Less than or equal to means that characters get +1 to wounds. Additionally, you can see which duty was triggered and provide +2 instead for that character. If the roll were doubles, then also double this effect for all players and triggering duty. (p.48)
- Can effect reputation. (p.325)
- Once the party's Duty Value reaches 100, their contribution rank is increased by 1, and is rewarded by the Alliance. Duty is then reset to 0. 
- Rewards can be: equipment, vehicle, strategic asset. Equipment, vehicle, or starship cannot be greater than rank 3 + contribution rank.
